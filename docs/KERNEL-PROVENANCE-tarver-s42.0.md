The archive contains the 15-file `S42/KLambda` reference kernel and Tarver's
standard library. As with S41.2, shen-cl builds a hybrid: these KLambda files
and StLib sources come from Tarver, while launcher/features/expand-dynamic,
ECL's precompiled `stlib.kl`, and certification tests are grafted from the
community ShenOSKernel-41.2 release until community S42 extensions are
published. The assembly script verifies the archive hash and keeps the
community graft version explicit.

The S42 archive reports `(version)` as `42`; this is the value used by the
CLI parity tests. Run `make fetch`, `make precompile SHEN=...`, and
`make build-sbcl` to regenerate local ignored kernel/compiled artifacts.
